Project Schedule Milestones:

Week 1: Add placeholder commands by following example in commit
46507, which adds the exist command. Make sure that commands can
be added and data is reflected internally.

Week 2: Identify ways of specifying to the command-line the parts of
model to be changed. For example, how to specify a vertex to a command
that removes a vertex and update the NMG model in the render window.

Week 3: Should be able to implement commands now. Allow two weeks
to complete each type of command. Starting this week with NMG CON-
STRUCTION ROUTINES.

Week 4: NMG - 2nd week for CONSTRUCTION ROUTINES.
